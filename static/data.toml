[[papers]]
title = "Evidence of Social Learning across Cultural Boundaries in Sperm Whales"
url = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05304"
published = "ArXiv 2023"
topic = "ceti"
summary = "Using variable length Markov models for modeling whale vocalizaations, we found that clans with geographic proximity exhibit more similar vocal styles, indicating social learning between clans."

[[papers]]
title = "Topological expressive power of Neural Networks"
url = "https://openreview.net/forum?id=I44kJPuvqPD"
published = "NeurIPS 2020"
topic = "tda"
summary = "We propose a topological description of neural network expressive power: the topology of the space of decision boundaries realized by a neural architecture."

[[papers]]
title = "On the Topological Complexity of Decision Boundaries"
url = "https://meetings3.sis-statistica.org/index.php/sis2021/index/pages/view/book"
published = "SIS 2021"
topic = "tda"
summary = "Classifying two concentric circles is challenging not because they are circles, but because they are concentric. We study and argue that the topology of the decision boundary of a classification problem is the most natural measure of its intrinsic complexity."
